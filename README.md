This is the source code of my website.

## How to use
To run the website locally first follow the setup and then run `gulp`.

NOTE: To make projects, education and skills working, you have to manually import the sql files from `database/` into your mysql database.

## Setup
1. Install PHP (if you haven't already)
2. Install MySQL (if you haven't already)
3. Make sure MySQL is running
4. Run `setup.sh` to setup PhpMyAdmin (Also works on bash on Windows)
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `gulp build`
